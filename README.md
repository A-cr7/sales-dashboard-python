# Sales Dashboard with SQL Integration

This project focuses on analyzing sales performance of active sellers using Python and MySQL. It is based on a dataset containing merchant-level information such as units sold, product pricing, ratings, and urgency metrics.

## What the Project Includes

- A **Python dashboard** (`sales_dashboard.py`) that reads a CSV file and creates visual charts using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
- A **MySQL connection script** (`sql_connect.py`) that uploads the data into a MySQL database using SQLAlchemy and pymysql.
- A **SQL query file** (`sql_queries.sql`) with some useful queries for extracting insights.

## Visualizations Created

- Listed products per seller (bar chart)
- Rating distribution (histogram)
- Distribution of product prices
- Urgency text rate vs urgency count (scatter plot)

## Tools & Libraries Used

- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
- MySQL database
- SQLAlchemy & pymysql for database connection
- VS Code for development

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Make sure Python and MySQL are installed.
3. Run `sql_connect.py` to upload the CSV data into MySQL.
4. Run `sales_dashboard.py` to generate visualizations.

## About the Dataset
